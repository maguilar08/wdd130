    <p>I am Marcelo, I am 24 years old. I am single. I have a big family we are 5 brothers when we used to be kids. we played a lot but sometimes we used to fight. Something that I really love is to go out from my house and take long walks especially when we go to camp. I like to play soccer, volleyball and swimming, though that is something that I stopped doing.

        I decided to learn about programming because I thing this field it is in all the things that we use every day. This kind of things help us to have better lives. All about programming has become new to me. It¬¥s too interesting how we can learn many things in a short time and be able to hold it.
        
        Three years ago, I started learning English, in which I am not yet as good as I would like. Every day I try to be a better and to do the things in the right way. My favorite scripture is,‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life‚Äù (John 3:16). I know that our father in heaven loves us as we can not imagine. We are so special for Him. A long my way, I learned that if we are sure about something. We have to do it and not leave it for the next day, just do it.</p>
